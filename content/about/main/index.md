  Ujamaa is the name my personal blog, where I share my curiosity. Ujamaa is a Swahili word that means a commitment to the practice of shared social wealth and the work necessary to achieve it. Literally, it means familyhood and suggests a sharing of work and wealth in the manner of a family. [To learn more about it](https://www.officialkwanzaawebsite.org/ujamaa.html)
