## Introduction

An online retail business wants to better understand their customers behavior in order to better target them. For that, we can **perform** a customer segmentation, and group customers by their purchase activity. 

Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customer by specificity (demographics, beahavior, georphics, etc.). Creating customer segmentation allows business to target specific group of customers and personalize marketing for each group.
